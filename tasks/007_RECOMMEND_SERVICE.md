# AI Recommendation Service Implementation

## Objective
Implement a sophisticated book recommendation system using OpenAI's GPT models with multiple recommendation strategies and fallback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### User-Specific Recommendations
1. Top-Rated Books for User
   - Filter books based on user's reading history
   - Consider user's rating patterns
   - Implement personalized sorting algorithm
   - Cache results for performance

2. Similar Books Discovery
   - Analyze user's favorite books
   - Match by genres and themes
   - Consider reading patterns
   - Include trending books in similar categories

3. AI-Powered Recommendations
   - Integrate OpenAI's API
   - Generate personalized book suggestions
   - Consider user's reading history and preferences
   - Implement content-based filtering

### Technical Implementation
1. OpenAI Integration
   - Set up secure API key management
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Handle API quotas and costs
   - Cache API responses

2. Recommendation Engine
   - Implement multiple recommendation algorithms
   - Create weighted scoring system
   - Set up result filtering and ranking
   - Optimize response times

3. Fallback System
   - Create non-AI fallback recommendations
   - Implement caching mechanism
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Handle error cases gracefully

## Technical Considerations
- Maximum latency: 15 seconds
- Cache validity: 24 hours
- API rate limiting: 100 requests/minute
- Minimum recommendation count: 5 books
- Error handling and logging
- Asynchronous processing where possible
- Database optimization for quick retrieval
- Regular cache updates for trending books

## Performance Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds for non-AI recommendations
- Response time < 5 seconds for AI recommendations
- 99.9% availability for fallback system
- Maximum 1MB response size

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User-Specific Features
   - System successfully returns personalized top-rated books
   - Similar book recommendations match user preferences
   - AI recommendations are contextually relevant
   - All recommendations exclude books already read/reviewed

2. Technical Requirements
   - OpenAI integration works reliably with proper error handling
   - Fallback system activates within 100ms of AI failure
   - Cache system effectively reduces API calls
   - Response times meet specified requirements

3. Quality Metrics
   - Recommendation relevance score > 80%
   - User engagement rate > 15%
   - Cache hit rate > 90%
   - Error rate < 0.1%

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all recommendation algorithms
- Integration tests for OpenAI API
- Performance tests for response times
- Load tests for concurrent requests
- Cache efficiency tests
